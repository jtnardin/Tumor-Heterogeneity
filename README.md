# Tumor-Heterogeneity

Tutorial code to go along with the submitted manuscript "A Tutorial Review of Mathematical Techniques for Quantifying Tumor Heterogeneity" by Rebecca Everett, Kevin Flores, Nick Henscheid, John Lagergren, Kamila Larripa, Ding Li, John Nardini, Phuong T T Nguyen, E. Bruce Pitman, and Erica M. Rutter. 

Each section contains code to replicate the results present in the manuscript, namely, nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NMLE), virtual populations (VPOP), Nonparametric Estimation, Bayesian Estimation, and Machine Learning - GANs and VAEs (ML). Within each folder, the requirements for running the code are stipulated including which programs may be necessary. Code is mostly written in either MATLAB or python.  

Note: The code is currently under construction and will be complete by Friday 5/20/20.
